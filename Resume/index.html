        <h2>Predictor for Coefficient of Thermal Expansion of carbon fiber and epoxy matrix</h2>
        <h3>Description: </h3>
        <p>To predict the Thermal properties of CFRP and epoxy matrix using Images of the region of
            the matrix as input. Used Dimensionality Reduction to compress the data and reduce the training time
        </p>
        <h2>German Traffic Sign Detection Model</h2>
        <h3>Description: </h3>
        <p>
            This was a problem statement in the intra-IIT Tech summit. The GTSRB dataset on which
            the model was trained has 43 classes, more than 50,000 images in total, and was a multi-class classification
            problem. The model can detect and identify 48 different traffic signs (with 5 more classes that were added as
            a part of the extended problem statement).
        </p>
        <h2>The Vital Extraction Challenge</h2>
        <h3>Description: </h3>
        <p>This was a problem statement in the inter IIT Tech meet 11.0. In this project, The core problem statement was to
            extract Heart Rate, SpO2, RR, Systolic Blood Pressure, Diabolic Blood Pressure, and MAP from the provided
            images. We used Mask RCNN to first filter out the necessary part of the image which was the screen. Then we
            made a classification model to classify the type of monitor and then used mask RCNN to filter out the part of the
            images where the vitals were present. Then used the model we made to extract the digits to get the vitals
        </p>
        <h2>Sudoku Solver</h2>
        <h3>Description: </h3>
        <p>This website is a automatic sudoku solver that solves almost any sudoku puzzle in matter of second. It applies
            Backtracking for quick solution</p>
